To quote: JetSurF Version 2.0 - A working model for the combustion of n-alkane up to n-dodecane, cyclohexane, and mono-alkylated cyclohexane up to n-butyl-cyclohexane. See the Stanford webpage for details. 348 species, 2163 reactions, 300 to 2000 K. Thermodynamics refit for a number of species to eliminate midpoint temperature issues.

TODO: What fuels the JetSurf2 can model?
* <= n-dodecane
